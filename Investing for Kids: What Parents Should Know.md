Recently I’ve been considering starting early investing for my children — but the rules around kids’ investment accounts and tax can be confusing. So I did some research. 

In Australia, there are mainly three options: Commsec minor trust account, Vanguard kids accounts and Investment bonds/insurance bonds. 
Here’s a simple comparision of these options:👇


| Option                    | Account Fees            | Tax Rate                | CGT on transfer               | Investment Choice       | Admin Burden | Best For                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Vanguard Kids Account** | $0 (Vanguard only)      | Minor tax rates (0–66%) | ❌ No (same beneficial owner) | Vanguard ETFs/Funds     | Low          | Long-term, low-cost ETF investing |
| **CommSec Minor Account** | Standard brokerage      | Minor tax rates         | ❌ No                         | Any ASX share/ETF       | Medium       | Flexible investors                |
| **Investment Bond**       | 1–2% management fee     | 30% internal tax        | ❌ No                         | Limited managed options | Very Low     | “Set & forget” 10-year plan       |

🥐 1. Vanguard Kids Account

A flexible, low-cost option if you’re happy to invest only in Vanguard products.

How it works:
You open the account in your child’s name (as beneficial owner) with you as trustee.
You can invest lump sums whenever you like — no need for regular deposits.

✅ Pros:

$0 account fee if you only hold Vanguard products

No brokerage fees on Vanguard ETFs

No CGT when your child turns 18 (ownership doesn’t change)

Great for long-term, hands-off investing

❌ Cons:

Must use the child’s TFN

Dividends taxed at minor rates (high for income over $416)

Franking credits expire if you don’t lodge a return that year

Only Vanguard products available

Best for:
Parents planning occasional lump-sum and regular investments and wanting to keep things simple and low cost.

💵 2. CommSec Minor Trust Account

A standard share-trading account in a child’s name (with a parent as trustee).

✅ Pros:

Access to all listed shares and ETFs (not just Vanguard)

Same beneficial ownership arrangement — no CGT when child turns 18

Easy transition to full CommSec account at 18

❌ Cons:

Standard brokerage each trade, depending on the trade amount

Must use child’s TFN → minor tax rates apply

Higher admin effort if trading multiple ETFs

Slightly higher ongoing costs than Vanguard for small balances

Best for:
Parents who want more flexibility (e.g. choosing different ETFs or shares), and who are comfortable paying brokerage for each trade.

🏦 3. Investment Bonds / Insurance Bonds

A mix of investment and insurance, offered by companies like Australian Unity, AMP, or Generation Life.

✅ Pros:

Taxed internally at 30%, no need for annual tax return

If held 10+ years, withdrawals are tax-free

Can nominate your child as beneficiary

Hands-off and compliant with all minor tax rules

❌ Cons:

Locked in for 10 years (withdraw early → extra tax)

Higher management fees (often 1–2% p.a.)

Less transparent than ETFs

Fewer investment choices

Best for:
Parents wanting a “set and forget” 10-year plan with no tax paperwork each year.

⚖️ Key Points for Investing for Kids

🧒 1. Who actually owns the investment?

If you set up an account like a Vanguard Kids Account using money from your child’s bank account — and the dividends go back to your 
child — then your child is the beneficial owner.

That means:

The investment income belongs to your child, not you.

The child’s TFN should be linked to the account.

💡 2. Do kids need to lodge a tax return?

It depends on how much income they earn.

According to the ATO:
| Annual “unearned” income (dividends, interest) | Tax                     | Tax return required?  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| $0 – $416                                      | No tax                  | ❌ No                 |
| $417 – $1,307                                  | 66% on income over $416 | ✅ Yes                |
| Over $1,307                                    | 45% on full amount      | ✅ Yes                |


So if your child earns less than $416 in dividends per year, there’s no tax and no need to lodge a return.

🧾 3. What about franking credits?

Some Australian ETFs and shares come with franking credits — tax already paid by the company that can be refunded to the investor.
👉 You can only claim them in the year you receive them.
If you skip lodging a return that year, the credits expire and can’t be claimed later.

💸 4. Simple, low-tax setup idea

Use your child’s bank account (where you or relatives gift money).

Open a Vanguard Kids Account under the child’s name (you as trustee).

Invest lump sums occasionally (no need for monthly contributions).

Keep annual dividends under $416 to avoid tax and paperwork.

This way, your child starts building wealth early — while you stay on the right side of ATO rules.

🌱 Final thought

Investing for your kids doesn’t have to be complicated.
Start small, keep it under their name, reinvest the earnings, and watch it grow.
Even a few thousand dollars in low-cost ETFs today could make a big difference by the time they turn 18.
